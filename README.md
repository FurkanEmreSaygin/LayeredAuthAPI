That's an excellent request! Creating a comprehensive README.md file is the perfect way to document and finalize our project. This file will serve as the instruction manual, explaining the architecture, setup, and key features to anyone (including your future self) who uses the project.

Here is the professional README.md content, summarizing everything we have built and fixed.

FoundationAuth API (.NET 9)
This project provides a robust, foundational User Authentication and Authorization API built using a modern Layered Architecture (N-Tier) approach in ASP.NET Core.

It is designed to be a secure, reusable core for any larger application requiring authenticated user management.

üöÄ Key Features
Architecture: Strict separation across 4 Layers (Domain, DataAccess, Business, API) ensuring maintainability.

Authentication: Industry-standard JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure session management.

Security: Password hashing implemented with BCrypt, ensuring highly secure storage.

Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for granular endpoint protection (Admin, User roles).

Data Management: EF Core Code First approach with support for MSSQL (LocalDB).

Data Integrity: AutoMapper for safe, decoupled data transfer between layers (Entity to DTO).

Configuration Security: Sensitive keys and connection strings are managed securely outside the source code using User Secrets.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Layers
Layer	Responsibility	Dependencies
Api (Presentation)	Handles HTTP requests, configures infrastructure (DI, JWT, Swagger).	Business
Business (Service)	Implements core business logic (Register, Login, Token Generation). Uses DTOs.	DataAccess, Domain
DataAccess (Data)	Manages database operations (CRUD) and Entity Framework Core context.	Domain
Domain (Core)	Defines core entities (User) and enums.	None

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
This project requires the .NET SDK (targeting .NET 9) and a running instance of SQL Server LocalDB to function.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
From the project root directory (where the Solution file is located), restore all NuGet packages:

Bash

dotnet restore
Step 2: Configure Secure Secrets
We use User Secrets to prevent sensitive values like the JWT secret key and database passwords from being committed to Git.

Navigate to the Api project directory and run the following commands:

Bash

# 1. Initialize the User Secrets feature
dotnet user-secrets init

# 2. Set the JWT Secret Key (MUST match the key configured in appsettings.json)
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtSettings:SecretKey" "This-should-be-a-very-long-and-secret-key-at-least-16-characters-long"
Step 3: Create the Database (Migration)
The database schema needs to be applied to your LocalDB instance. Run the following commands from the project root:

Bash

# 1. Create Migration files (if not already done)
dotnet ef migrations add FinalSetup --project DataAccess --startup-project Api

# 2. Apply the schema and create the database in LocalDB
dotnet ef database update --project DataAccess --startup-project Api
Note on Connection Errors: If you encounter a connection error, verify that the Server= value in your appsettings.json is correct for your local SQL Server/LocalDB instance (e.g., (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB).

Step 4: Start the API
Start the application. The Swagger UI should open automatically in your browser.

Bash

dotnet run --project Api
üîë API Endpoints
Use the Swagger UI interface to test the full functionality of the API.

Method	Endpoint	Description	Requires Authorization
POST	/api/Auth/register	Creates a new user account. (Default Role: User)	None
POST	/api/Auth/login	Authenticates a user and returns a JWT Token.	None
GET	/api/Auth/profile	Retrieves the authenticated user's profile information.	JWT Token
PUT	/api/Auth/profile	Allows the user to update their username, email, or password.	JWT Token
GET	/api/Auth/admin-test	Restricted endpoint only accessible by users with the Admin role.	JWT Token + Role Check

Testing Authorization
Login and copy the resulting JWT Token.

Click the Authorize button in Swagger and paste the token in the format: Bearer [your_token].

Attempt to call /api/Auth/admin-test. It should return a 403 Forbidden status for a standard registered user, confirming the role-based security is functional.
