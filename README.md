# LayeredAuthAPI
This project serves as a robust and scalable starting point (starter kit) for building user management features (Registration, Login) using a modern **4-Layer Architecture** (Domain, Data Access, Business, API).  It's designed to be the *foundation* for your future projects, emphasizing clean code, separation of concerns, and security.
